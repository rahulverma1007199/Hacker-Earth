You have been given 3 integers - l, r and k. Find how many numbers between l and r (both inclusive) are divisible by k. You do not need to print these numbers, you just have to find their count.
Code:

import java.util.Scanner;
class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
       	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int i =sc.nextInt();
		int r = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		int count = 0;
		for (int j=i;j<=r;j++) {
			int rem = j%k;
			if(rem == 0) {
				count++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
    }
}
